What are Association Rules?

It is a rule-based machine learning technique used to find patterns (relationships, structures) in data.

Association analysis applications are among the most common applications in data science. It will also come across as recommendation systems.

These applications may have come to you in the following ways, such as "those who bought that product also bought this product" or "those who viewed that ad also looked at these ads" or "we created a playlist for you" or "the recommended video for the next video".

These scenarios will be the most common scenarios within the scope of e-commerce data science data mining studies.

and the world's largest e-commerce company in Turkey, spotify, amazon, it uses many platforms like netflix recommendation systems can know a little more closely.

So what do these association analyzes do?

Apriori Algorithm

It is the most used method in this field.

Association rule analysis is performed by examining some metrics:

- Support

- Support (X, Y) = Freq (X, Y) / N

X: item Y: item N: total purchase

- Confidence
- Confidence (X, Y) = Freq (X, Y) / Freq (X)

- Lift
- Lift = Support (X, Y) / (Support (X) * Support (Y))

Data file is attached to repo
